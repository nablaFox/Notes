# UniNotes 
> Curated Knowledge

## Todo

Design:
- favicon
- color theme
- home layout
- catalogue layout 
- course layout
- insight layout
- assign a characteristic color to each "course"

Features:
- divide each corse in categories
- link each course to the related insights 
- add a toggleable recap (my current indeces) to the course layout
- make the connection between an insight and its course clear (for example by adding a link at the end of page)
- bibliography page

Other:
- find an another name for "courses" and "catalogue". "Insights" might be ok
